## Overview

**Articles Classifier** is a machine learning / NLP project for automatic classification of articles.  
Given an input text (e.g. news articles), the system predicts a category based on a trained model.  

It can be used for:  
- Content tagging  
- Topic categorization  
- Recommendation systems  
- Any pipeline needing structured labels from articles

---

## Features

- Train a classification model on labeled article data ([data used](https://huggingface.co/datasets/MarcOrfilaCarreras/spanish-news))
- Predict categories for new articles  
- Preprocessing pipeline: cleaning, embeddings  
- Evaluation with metrics and confusion matrix  
- Modular architecture â€“ easy to extend with new datasets or models

Comming in next version:
- Unit, Integration and E2E testing
- Improvements in the model (We are still researching and trying to get better results in all categories)

---

## Architecture & Approach

1. **Data ingestion & preprocessing**  
   - Load labeled dataset  
   - Clean articles 
   - Extract features (embeddings)  

2. **Model training & selection**  
   - Train ML models (XGBoost, but we also got good results using Logistic Regression)  
   - Hyperparameter tuning  
   - Cross-validation
   - Save model for future predictions

3. **Inference & prediction**  
   - Predict labels for unseen text  
   - Return category + probabilities of other categories

## ðŸ“¦ Getting Started

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JuaniLlaberia/articles_classifier
   cd articles_classifier
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run Agent locally (FastAPI):

   ```bash
   python .
   ```

With that you can start classifying articles using this trained model, if you want to further explore or train, you will need to download the [data](https://huggingface.co/datasets/MarcOrfilaCarreras/spanish-news) as is not provided in the repo.
